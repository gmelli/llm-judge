## Definition
An **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation System** is a software system that employs one or more Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform automated evaluation of content against formally defined categories, where the LLM acts as an intelligent judge capable of understanding semantic meaning, context, and nuanced properties that traditional rule-based or statistical methods cannot adequately assess.

The category is well-defined by its necessary properties (LLM core, formal categories, semantic understanding, structured output) and distinguished from related systems by its unique combination of learned evaluation capabilities and systematic framework. As LLMs continue to improve and costs decrease, LLM-as-Judge systems are likely to become the standard approach for automated content evaluation across numerous domains.
